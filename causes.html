                                Deforestation occurs due to various human activities driven by the need for resources and land. One major cause is agricultural
                                expansion. As the global population grows, there's a higher demand for land to cultivate crops and raise livestock. This often 
                                leads to clearing large areas of forests for farming. Logging is another significant contributor to deforestation.

                                Timber is a valuable resource for construction, paper production, and other industries. As a result, extensive logging can lead to the
                                depletion of forests. Urbanization is also a cause, as cities and infrastructure projects require land, prompting the clearing 
                                of forests. 
                            </li>
                            <li id="point">

                                Additionally, forest fires, whether natural or human-induced, play a role in deforestation, destroying large areas 
                                of trees. Finally, the extraction of minerals and oil contributes to deforestation, as it necessitates the clearing of land for 
                                mining activities.
