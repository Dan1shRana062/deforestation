                <p class="myP">Deforestation is the process of clearing or removing a large number of trees in a forested area.</p>

                                Deforestation means cutting down a lot of trees in a big forest. This happens because people need space for farming, cutting wood, or building cities. It's not good for the environment. When we cut down trees, many animals and plants lose their homes
                                ,and some might disappear forever.
                            </li>
                            <li id="point">
                                Trees also help keep the Earth's air clean by taking in a gas called carbon dioxide. But when we cut them, that gas goes back into the air
                                ,making the Earth warmer.
                            </li>
                            <li id="point">
                                Deforestation can also mess up how water moves in the ground and causes problems like dirt washing away. It's not just about the environment; people who live in the forest lose their homes and ways of making a living.
                                So, stopping deforestation is really important to keep our planet healthy for everyone.
